Timebank is an ERP for companies deploying crews to jobsites. They report their time on project, and invoicing is automatically generated for each project as it is completed. 

Companies can decide to:
- allow crews to bank hours that are held in credit for when they need it
- Stripe handles the invoicing and takes a fee for the fee
- a 3-15% service charge on each invoice payment that can be passed off to the customer or subtracted from payouts to Company
